In an ideal transmission system with an ideal passband, the system would perfectly transmit all frequency components within its passband without introducing distortion. However, I’m wondering how destructive interference in the frequency domain (e.g., from overlapping side lobes of sinc spectra) would affect the time-domain signal.

If destructive interference happens within the passband, would this still degrade the time-domain signal? My understanding is that if the system behaves ideally in the passband, the interference in the frequency domain would simply be transmitted as is, without causing time-domain distortion directly—since the system itself isn't introducing new errors.

Also, I understand that frequency-domain distortion doesn’t necessarily translate to time-domain distortion. In practice, time-domain distortion often results from imperfections in real-world systems, such as drivers with finite slew rates or transmission mediums with parasitic effects. Could you clarify if my understanding is correct?
